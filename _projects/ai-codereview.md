# AI Code Review Assistant

## ü§ñ Project Overview

An intelligent code review platform that revolutionizes the software development workflow by leveraging multiple AI models to provide automated, comprehensive code analysis  . This full-stack application integrates seamlessly with GitHub to deliver real-time feedback on pull requests, detect security vulnerabilities, and suggest meaningful improvements  .

## ‚ú® Key Features

### **Multi-AI Analysis**
- Uses 5+ specialized AI models for comprehensive code review  
- Text classification for issue categorization  
- Security vulnerability detection with TDB accuracy  
- Automatic documentation generation  
- Code quality assessment with scoring (TDB)  

### **Security-First Approach**
- Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities  
- Identifies XSS risks and authentication bypasses  
- Finds data exposure risks  
- Spots security anti-patterns  

### **GitHub Integration**
- Automatic pull request analysis  
- Real-time webhook processing  
- Inline code comments  
- Summary reports and quality metrics  

### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **Complexity analysis** with cyclomatic complexity scoring
- **Code smell detection** and refactoring suggestions
- **Performance optimization** recommendations
- **Best practices enforcement** for each programming language

### **Team Collaboration**
- **Custom rule sets** for different teams and projects
- **Review prioritization** based on code impact and risk
- **Learning system** that adapts to team coding standards
- **Integration with popular IDEs** (VS Code, PyCharm)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### **Backend Implementation (Python/FastAPI)**

## üîí Security & Performance

### **API Security**
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse (TDB requests per hour)  
- Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement with security headers

### **Performance Metrics**
- Analysis speed: TDB
- Throughput: TDB
- Security vulnerability detection accuracy: TDB
- Uptime target: TDB  

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- Unit tests for AI analysis accuracy and consistency
- Integration tests for GitHub API functionality
- End-to-end tests for complete workflow validation
- Performance tests for throughput and latency optimization

## üéØ Business Impact

### **Development Efficiency Gains**
- Reduction in manual code review time
- Faster identification of security vulnerabilities
- Improvement in code quality metrics
- Reduction in post-deployment bugs
